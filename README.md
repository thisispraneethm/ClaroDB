# ClaroDB - The Intelligent, Browser-Based Data Workspace

ClaroDB is an intelligent data workspace that allows you to connect to data sources, ask questions in natural language, and get insights, SQL queries, and visualizations generated by AI. It's built with a "privacy-first" approach, ensuring all your data is processed and stored securely within your browser.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Conversational Data Analysis:** Simply ask questions in plain English, and ClaroDB's AI, powered by the Google Gemini API, will generate the corresponding SQL query.
*   **Analyze Local Files:** Upload single CSV, JSON, or TXT files for quick analysis. Includes optional data sampling for large datasets to improve performance.
*   **Visual Join Builder:** Upload multiple files and create complex data models by visually dragging and dropping to join tables on an interactive canvas.
*   **AI-Powered Insights & Visualizations:** Go beyond raw data. Generate automatic textual summaries and rich, interactive charts (bar, line, pie, etc.) from your query results.
*   **Privacy First Architecture:** Your data never leaves your computer. All file parsing, data storage (via IndexedDB), and query execution (via AlaSQL) happens entirely on the client-side.
*   **Demo & Mock Environments:** Includes a pre-loaded Demo Workspace and a simulated Enterprise DB connection to explore features without needing your own data.
*   **Self-Improving SQL:** The system learns from your manual corrections to SQL queries, improving the accuracy of future generations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher recommended)
*   A package manager like [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), npm, or yarn.
*   A Google Gemini API Key.

### Installation & Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd clarodb
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    # or npm install / yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure your API Key:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Google Gemini API key. The application uses Vite to automatically load this variable.
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    # or npm run dev / yarn dev
    ```
    The application will be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

ClaroDB is fundamentally designed to protect your data privacy.

*   **No Data Upload:** Your raw data files are never uploaded to a remote server. They are parsed and loaded directly into your browser's memory.
*   **Client-Side Execution:** All SQL queries are executed within your browser using AlaSQL against the data stored in IndexedDB.
*   **Secure AI Interaction:** The only information sent to the Google Gemini API is the table schema (table and column names/types), your natural language question, and conversation history. Your actual data rows remain on your machine.
